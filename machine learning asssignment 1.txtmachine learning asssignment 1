
Explain Machine Learning with your own example?


Machine kearning is process wherre every thing is process automatically,
â€œIn classic terms, machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables self-learning from
 data and then applies that learning without the need for human intervention,
 machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

Ex:- Automated Stop Barrier is one of the Example of  machine Learing, when heavy vehicle 
pass though toll naka, Barrier automatically gets dow and stop the vechile, and after completing process, the bar automatically  automatically get's upward,
this all process is done through censor, when vechile go through the censor and it detects the object and then boom barries stop the car.
In Machine learning this is Type Of {CNN}.
